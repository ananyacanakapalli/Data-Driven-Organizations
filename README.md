# Academic Article on Data-Driven Organizations

This repository contains my academic article which explores the critical factors that influence the success of data initiatives within organizations. The article is inspired by discussions and questions that arose from two influential Harvard Business Review (HBR) articles: "Your Data Strategy Needs to Include Everyone" and "Why Do Chief Data Officers Have Such Short Tenures?"

The purpose of my article is to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the importance of data in modern organizations. By examining the HBR articles and the questions they raise, I aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of the role of data strategy and leadership in fostering a data-driven culture.
